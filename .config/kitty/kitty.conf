#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      Fira Code
# bold_font        auto
# italic_font      auto
# bold_italic_font auto
#
font_size 11.0

# adjust_line_height  0
# adjust_column_width 0

#: Change the size of each character cell kitty renders. You can use
#: either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
#: (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
#: unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less
#: than 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering
#: artifacts).

# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols

#: Map the specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful
#: if you need special rendering for some symbols, such as for
#: Powerline. Avoids the need for patched fonts. Each unicode code
#: point is specified in the form U+<code point in hexadecimal>. You
#: can specify multiple code points, separated by commas and ranges
#: separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple
#: times. Syntax is::

#:     symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name

# box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: Performance tuning {{{

# repaint_delay 10

#: Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either
#: set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh
#: rate.

# input_delay 3

#: Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
#: the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.

#: Advanced {{{

# shell .

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login to ensure that the shell starts in interactive mode and
#: reads its startup rc files.

# editor .

#: The console editor to use when editing the kitty config file or
#: similar tasks. A value of . means to use the environment variable
#: EDITOR. Note that this environment variable has to be set not just
#: in your shell startup scripts but system-wide, otherwise kitty will
#: not see it.

# close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. If no (the
#: default), the terminal will remain open when the child exits as
#: long as there are still processes outputting to the terminal (for
#: example disowned or backgrounded processes). If yes, the window
#: will close as soon as the child process exits. Note that setting it
#: to yes means that any background processes still using the terminal
#: can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

# allow_remote_control no

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over ssh
#: connections.

# startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
#: individual instances. See sessions in the kitty documentation for
#: details. Note that relative paths are interpreted with respect to
#: the kitty config directory. Environment variables in the path are
#: expanded.

# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: set of possible actions is: write-clipboard read-clipboard write-
#: primary read-primary The default is to allow writing to the
#: clipboard and primary selection. Note that enabling the read
#: functionality is a security risk as it means that any program, even
#: one running on a remote server via SSH can read your clipboard.

# term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on Stack Overflow
#: to change it.

#: }}}

#: OS specific tweaks {{{

# macos_titlebar_color system

#: Change the color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value
#: of system means to use the default system color, a value of
#: background means to use the background color of the currently
#: active window and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as
#: #12af59 or red. WARNING: This option works by using a hack, as
#: there is no proper Cocoa API for it. It sets the background color
#: of the entire window and makes the titlebar transparent. As such it
#: is incompatible with background_opacity. If you want to use both,
#: you are probably better off just hiding the titlebar with
#: macos_hide_titlebar.

# macos_hide_titlebar no

#: Hide the kitty window's title bar on macOS.

# x11_hide_window_decorations no

#: Hide the window decorations (title bar and window borders) on X11
#: and Wayland. Whether this works and exactly what effect it has
#: depends on the window manager, as it is the job of the window
#: manager/compositor to draw window decorations.

# macos_option_as_alt yes

#: Use the option key as an alt key. With this set to no, kitty will
#: use the macOS native Option+Key = unicode character behavior. This
#: will break any Alt+key keyboard shortcuts in your terminal
#: programs, but you can use the macOS unicode input technique.

# macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: Hide the kitty window from running tasks (Option+Tab) on macOS.

# macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed. By
#: default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as is
#: the expected behavior on macOS.

# macos_window_resizable yes

#: Disable this if you want kitty top-level (OS) windows to not be
#: resizable on macOS.

#: }}}

#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: For a list of key names, see: GLFW keys
#: <http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__keys.html>. The name to use
#: is the part after the GLFW_KEY_ prefix. For a list of modifier
#: names, see: GLFW mods
#: <http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you should only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not present in the list of GLFW keys.

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration.

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: this will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts using the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

# kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: The value of kitty_mod is used as the modifier for all default
#: shortcuts, you can change it in your kitty.conf to change the
#: modifiers for all the default shortcuts.

# clear_all_shortcuts no

#: You can have kitty remove all shortcut definition seen up to this
#: point. Useful, for instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

#: Clipboard {{{

# map kitty_mod+c  copy_to_clipboard
# map kitty_mod+v  paste_from_clipboard
# map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
# map shift+insert paste_from_selection
# map kitty_mod+o  pass_selection_to_program

#: You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#: program using pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#: open program is used, but you can specify your own, for example::

#:     map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#: You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running in
#: a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#:     map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

#: }}}

#: Scrolling {{{

# map kitty_mod+up        scroll_line_up
# map kitty_mod+k         scroll_line_up
# map kitty_mod+down      scroll_line_down
# map kitty_mod+j         scroll_line_down
# map kitty_mod+page_up   scroll_page_up
# map kitty_mod+page_down scroll_page_down
# map kitty_mod+home      scroll_home
# map kitty_mod+end       scroll_end
# map kitty_mod+h         show_scrollback

#: You can send the contents of the current screen + history buffer as
#: stdin to an arbitrary program using the placeholders @text (which
#: is the plain text) and @ansi (which includes text styling escape
#: codes). For only the current screen, use @screen or @ansi_screen.
#: For example, the following command opens the scrollback buffer in
#: less in a new window::

#:     map kitty_mod+y new_window @ansi less +G -R

#: }}}

#: Miscellaneous {{{

# map kitty_mod+f11    toggle_fullscreen
# map kitty_mod+u      input_unicode_character
# map kitty_mod+f2     edit_config_file
# map kitty_mod+escape kitty_shell window

#: Open the kitty shell in a new window/tab/overlay/os_window to
#: control kitty using commands.

# map kitty_mod+a>m set_background_opacity +0.1
# map kitty_mod+a>l set_background_opacity -0.1
# map kitty_mod+a>1 set_background_opacity 1
# map kitty_mod+a>d set_background_opacity default

#: You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#: client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example::

#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#: This will send "Special text" when you press the ctrl+alt+a key
#: combination.  The text to be sent is a python string literal so you
#: can use escapes like \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send
#: unicode characters (or you can just input the unicode characters
#: directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument to send_text is the
#: keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
#: values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated
#: combination of them.  The special keyword all means all modes. The
#: modes normal and application refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode
#: for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty extended
#: keyboard protocol.

#: Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor to
#: the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key)::

#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH
